Please enter an integer value between 1 and 5: 4
The value you entered is 4, which means division.
Enter two floats values separated by a space: 
12.0 0
Float values that were entered are: 12.0 and0.0
Use the division operation.

You cannot divide by zero(0). You must enter your floats again. 

 

Enter two floats values separated by a space: 
12.0 3
The result of your division operation is:         0.00
